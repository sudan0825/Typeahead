1. Support functions: Typeahead, sum, display result accroding query

2. Using mylibrary.js as an external library that provides an object with functions (extract content in the input box and convert it to arrary.)

3. Using AngularJS directive create You can add any functions, such as count, max etc in the Angular service 

2. Typehead: when user inputs any character that is in the functionality database, Typehead will provide a sample formula. For example, when you input "s", the sample formula of "sum" will be displayed. End-user click on the reminding formula, the formula will show in the input box. Then the user can edit formula based on their needs. The reminding formula will keep there as a QUERY remider in case of end-user forget the formula he choose.

3. Be careful, no space is allowed in the queries.

4. If user CLICK on the submit button before entering anything in the input box, the system will reminder user to input a formula (in blue color)

5. If the formular is incorrect, the system will give out alert in red color

6. Date comparision only do for Count formula. Adding "date comparision" to other formular is similiar work.

7. This project is pure JS & AngularJS code. No other dependencies;  By un-zipping and runing in any front-end development enviroment (for example: Bracket), the program should work.
