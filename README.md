1. Support functions: Typeahead, sum, display result accroding query

2. Create a external library named mylibrary.js, which returns an object with functions (extract content in the input box and convert it to arrary.)

3. Create an AngularJS directive for Typeahead. 

4. Create an AngularJS service that valids the input arrary and return sum based on the query. You can add any functions, such as count, max accroding your requirements.

5. Typehead: when user inputs any character that is in the functionality database, Typehead will provide a sample formula. For example, when you input "s", the sample formula of "sum" will be displayed. End-user click on the reminding formula, the formula will show in the input box. Then the user can edit formula based on their needs. 

3. Be careful, no space is allowed in the queries.

4. If user CLICK on the submit button before entering anything in the input box, the system will reminder user to input a formula (in blue color)

5. If the formular is incorrect, the system will give out alert in red color

6. Date comparision only do for Count formula. Adding "date comparision" to other formular is similiar work.

7. This project is pure JS & AngularJS code. No other dependencies;  By un-zipping and runing in any front-end development enviroment (for example: Bracket), the program should work.
